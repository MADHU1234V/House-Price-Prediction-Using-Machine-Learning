# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
## Overview

This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques applied to historical housing data. It demonstrates a complete, end-to-end data science workflow, from raw data processing to model evaluation and price prediction.

The project is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand how real-world machine learning projects are structured and executed.

## Objectives

Analyze housing data to understand key price-influencing factors

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct exploratory data analysis using visualizations

Build and evaluate regression-based machine learning models

Predict house prices for new, unseen data

## Tech Stack

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn
